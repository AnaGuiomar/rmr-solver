## EMG data
This folder is used to collect the EMG data corresponding to the various tasks that are analyzed in our paper.
The movements were performed by a single subject, and are:
- unloaded abduction (ABD01, ABD02, ABD03)
- loaded abduction (ABD21, ABD22, ABD23)
- unloaded forward flexion (FLX01, FLX02, FLX03)
- loaded forward flexion (FLX21, FLX22, FLX23)
- unloaded shrugging (SHRUG01, SHRUG02, SHRUG03)
- loaded shrugging (SHRUG21, SHRUG22, SHRUG23)

You can get the data and populate your local version of the repository from the dataset available at https://simtk.org/projects/thoracoscapular.

It could be annoying, but we do not provide the dataset directly on purpose.
Why? We want to avoid duplicating it over and over, so that we can save memory and energy in the servers and appropriately credit the researchers who collected the data in the first place!
