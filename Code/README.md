The code collected here is divided in 3 folders:

- `Compute Muscle Activation`: stores the scripts required to perform both CMC and RMR analysis on the dataset
- `Data Processing`: contains all the scripts necessary to process the data
- `Image Generation`: stores the scripts used to analyze our results and generate the images included in the paper
