The code collected here is divided in 4 folders:

- `Compute Muscle Activation`: stores the scripts required to perform both CMC and RMR analysis on the dataset
- `Data Processing`: contains all the scripts necessary to process the data (utilities, and scripts used to perform statistical analysis on our results)
- `Image Generation`: stores the scripts used to analyze our results and generate the images included in the paper
- `Model Perturbation`: stores the scripts used to perturb randomly our models, accounting for intrinsic uncertainty in marker-based biomechanical studies
