The script to be run to get a scaled version of the Thoracoscapular model is `main_scaleModel.m`. In order to run, it makes use of the other scripts present in this folder, as well as some data processing scripts that can be found in `..\..\Data Processing\Matlab\`. A connection to the `PTbot` shared folder (usually called `U:` drive when connected to the TU Delft netwrok) is also required, to load the experimental data and the model to be scaled.
